**WARNING NOTE**
The release version mentioned in the source-code couldn't be found in git tags, \
    hence the release is created from the start.
If that is not the right behavior:

- Close this pull request & release issue.
- Fix the version string in source-code to reflect the latest git-tag, or create \
    the missing tag pointing to the last release sha.
- Create a new release issue.

Automated version release could not be completed.

Kebechet version manager expects a file with one of the following names: `["setup.py", "__init__.py", "__about__.py",
"version.py", "app.py", "wsgi.py", "pyproject.toml"]` to contain the line:

```
...
version = X.Y.Z  (in pyproject.toml project section)
or
__version__ = X.Y.Z (in the rest of the options)
...
```

where `X.Y.Z` is the current semantic version. To fix this issue, add this line to one of these files. If none of these
files exist create one somewhere in your repository.
