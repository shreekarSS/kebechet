Version Manager
===============

This manager updates version information for your project. It allows for either
semantic versioning or calendar versioning. It will also generate changelogs
based on commits since the last version released.

Edit version information in sources and open a pull request with tagged commit.

This manager can simplify package releases for you. If you open an issue that
requests new version release, this manager will do actions needed on source code
level.

.. caution:: This manager does **NOT** create new releases. It only creates the
    changes in source code and changelogs. Additional CI must be added.

A requirement to make this manager operational is that your version should be
stated as a string in your ``setup.py``, ``version.py``, ``__about__.py``,
``__init__.py``, ``app.py`` or ``wsgi.py`` file in a variable named
``__version__``.

Optionally, Changelogs using Machine Learning and NLP can be generated through
`Glyph <https://github.com/thoth-station/glyph>`_

Prerequisites
-------------

#. You need one of the following files: ``setup.py``, ``version.py``,
   ``__about.py``, ``__init__.py``, ``app.py`` , ``wsgi.py`` or   ``pyproject.toml``  to contain the
   following line::
    version = "<current-version-string>" (in pyproject.toml project section)

    or

    __version__ = "<current-version-string>" (in the rest of the options)
